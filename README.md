Topical problems:
- The maximum output of the archive of conversations is limited, if necessary, you need to output it by several messages (fixed, need additional testing)
- An error occurs when the context exceeds about 4000 tokens, we need to think of a way to send no more than 4000 tokens of the conversation context to the API 
- Bot not working with private TG accounts
